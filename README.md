# Credit-Risk-Analysis
The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions.  We used a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, KNN, Artificial Neural Networks, and SMOTE that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones, which is the most efficient after comparison.
